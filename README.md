## Background

This project was a group effort. Udenna and Shane had the idea of making a website with a game that was like the popular rhythm game "OSU". While both collaborators worked on both the front and back end of the site, Udenna mainly worked on the JavaScript or front end and Shane mainly worked on the Ruby or back end. Shane created the analyzer which uses the Web Audio API to determine when the music gets louder than a specific frequency. Udenna took the analyzer and used it to make the buttons appear and make it so that the buttons should be pressed whenever the beat hits in the song.
